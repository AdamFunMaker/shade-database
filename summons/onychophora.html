                            The Onychophora dreading needing to actually move on its own, would rather leave its movement in completely in the hands of an allied character. 
                            The Onychophora will attach to a character to supplement a missing limb, and or missing body part. 
                            The body part cannot exceed the size of the Onychophora and body parts vital to the creatures survival can only be mimicked for a short duration, 
                            depending on the situation. Onychophorais also able to use a reaction to quickly plunge items or take out items from Infinite Abyss.

                            The Onychophora can shape shadows within 10ft, but unlike Shadow Manipulation, the shadows can be pulled from the surface to form animate objects. 
                            The animate objects created can be no larger than itself, and can only be simple objects such as chairs, dice, clubs etc. The Onychophora can control the object freely, 
                            launching it or levitating it as it wishes. Due to its cowardly nature, Onychophora will use its shadow manipulation technique to shield itself. 
                            If a character were to target specifically Onychophora with an attack roll, it will automatically use its reaction to manipulate shadows to defend itself, 
                            and increase its AC to 20 for one attack roll.

                            A character within 10ft must make a WIS save, on a fail, on the characters next turn, the Onychophora controls the movement but not the actions of the character. 
                            Once that characters turn ends, Onychophora is unsummoned and is treated as if its killed. 
                            If the target saves, Onychophora is instantly unsummoned and is treated as if its killed.
