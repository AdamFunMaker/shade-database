                Expose Weakness (3SP): 
                Mink raises its quills and makes a 30ft ranged attack + proficiency bonus +Host WIS against a creature. 
                On a successful hit, the Mink deals a 1d6+proficiency bonus damage type chosen by it's host, and the target gains vulnerability to that damage type 
                until the end of the targets next turn. If the target has Stalk Prey, the attack ignores resistances and is rolled as pent. 
                Regardless of whether the attack lands or not, the Mink is unsummoned and is treated as if it's killed.
