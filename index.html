                    When touching an object, you can rapidly displace or add
                    energy to it. For example, producing a fireball by holding a
                    lit flame and rapidly adding heat energy to it, or rapidly
                    taking away gravitational potential energy from an object,
                    preventing it from falling momentarily as it gathers it's
                    potential energy again. This technique is heavily SPIRIT
                    intensive, costing 6 SPIRIT per 6 seconds a technique is
                    active. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can add
                    additional magical damage to a spell cast equal to 1/5 of
                    SPIRIT used.
                    <br /><br />

                    As a bonus action, you can add red into ONE INSTANCE of the
                    effect of a spell or a cantrip that you cast in the same
                    turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has
                    red). When using red, the spell or cantrip will target the
                    enemy using it's Spirit DEF stat rather than its AC if it's
                    an attack roll. Red also allows the spell or cantrip to
                    ignore cover and line of sight, as well as extending the
                    range of the ability by 30 ft. By expending another 3SP for
                    a total of 9SP, you can enhance the effect of red on the
                    spell/cantrip and deal an additional d10 damage, and you can
                    change the damage type of the ray to any damage type (except
                    true).

                    By rapidly shifting energy and SPIRIT, the host can
                    transmute simple materials, such as a simple block of wood,
                    carbon etc. Additionally, by consuming an exorbitant amount
                    of SPIRIT, the host may attempt to transmute away solid
                    objects, but the rate at which is extremely slow and SPIRIT
                    inefficient. The more complex the object, the more SPIRIT it
                    takes.

                    As a bonus action, you can add blue into ONE INSTANCE of the

                    turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has
                    red). When using blue, you are able to delay the casting and
                    activation of spells and cantrips, storing the spell and
                    cantrip within an item, surface, object or materialise the
                    spell/cantrip as a barely physical blue orb. The spell will
                    automatically trigger when the object or surface is
                    destroyed, and if not, they are automatically casted at the
                    start of your next turn. By expending another 3SP for a
                    total of 9SP, you can enhance the effect of blue on the
                    spell/cantrip to deal an additional d10 damage and ignores

                    As a main action, by fusing Blue and Yellow together,

                    host becomes charged with massive amounts of energy and
                    Spirit before letting it release as multiple streams of
                    emerald green lightning blasts at an enemy. All creatures
                    within a 60ft cone will make a DEX save, on a successful
                    save they take half. Creatures will take damage equal to
                    (2+PB) d12 psychic damage, as this energy rends at the
                    Spirit and their Energy. Creatures who fail the save for
                    this ability will be unable to regain SPIRIT until the end
                    of their next turn.
