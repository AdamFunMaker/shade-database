          RULES
        </div>

        <div class="info-content">
            <ol>
                <li> Pent rules still apply, but instead of 2x dice rolls, it now rolls the damage dice twice and take the higher roll. Critical hits deal 2x damage dice.</li>
                <li> A quarter of all psychic damage dealt will also additionally deplete Spirit up to a maximum of 5 Spirit per instance of psychic damage.</li>
                <li> Rather than rolling initiative, we will be using LANCER initiative where you can pick who goes next and the teams alternate between turn orders. HOWEVER, the first player of the PC team will roll a initiative check against the first enemy of the NPC team, this will determine which team will take the first turn.</li>
                <li> Shade contracts will now require a sacrifice or offering to the Shade ala CSM devils. They no longer make contracts just to co-exist in the world. Additionally, taking more shades will drastically put pressure on your Spirit stat, reducing your Spirit stat by 10 with each new Shade. Other than that, harboring more than one Shade may lead to problems between the Shades.</li>
                <li> Essence system is scrapped, rather Shade abilities will naturally evolve as you push your characters and the Shade's bond to the limit. But upgrades will be much more rare and used more as a narrative tool. Still, expect your character to grow over time along with your contracted Shades as their bonds grow.</li>
                <li> Shade powers will now be a lot more roleplay friendly</li>
                <li> There will be a number of new base abilities that ALL Shade Hunter PCs have access to, this list of abilities will be revealed later</li>
                <li> All DnD races are still available during character creation, but we will be playing a human only world, so all will be reflavored as such. The setting will be in the modern day, just like before</li>
                <li> When characters are downed, instantly fail a death save. This cannot occur if on the characters last death save.</li>
                <li> Pent is currently at +7 AC</li>
                <li> Characters who are shapeshifted or polymorphed suffer from Shapeshifted Penalty as they struggle to atune to their forms and channel Spirit into their abilities properly. ALL abilties that use SP have their cost increased by 2x, includes Shade abilities, Simple domains, Channeling Spirit etc.</li>
                <li> You can only use potions as a main action</li>
                <li> Coordinated Attack!: Applicable to hunters that can summon their Shades physically (Shade of Shadows, Shade of Death), you can use your bonus action command your summon, the summon will take its turn right after yours, ignoring the alternating turn order.</li>
