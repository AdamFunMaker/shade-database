            <p>When using a non-blank domain expansion, You can choose to create the domain at a much smaller space, condensing it but strengthening your authority over that space. The domain expansion will only be 10ft radius and will ignore the effects of the blank domains. The space where the compacted domain and another domain overlaps will become neutral, and neither domain expansions effects will register in that area. The domain can still be forcibly clashed with as a main action, however the compacted domain only needs to roll 3/4 of the rolled value.

The domain's effects will apply as if the targets have been in the domain for one turn. The domain will quickly collapse afterwards, however, by expanding domain so quickly, the host expands the domain and resolves the effects of the domain FASTER than a domain clash can occur, bypassing a domain clash and a blank domains effects.

                    In dire moments of need, your soul pushes the limits of your body even past what it is physically capable of, ordering it to move despite how broken it may be.
