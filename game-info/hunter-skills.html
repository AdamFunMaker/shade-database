                    <dd>

                    <dd>
                        As a main action, you can expend Spirit to rapidly regenerate your HP.  You may heal up to a maximum of half your characters maximum HP.

                    <dd>
                        As a free action, you can immediately call upon your Shade, make a sacrifice, the sacrifice must be sufficient for the Shade. If so the Shade can do one of four things:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rejuvenate all your SPIRIT</li>
                            <li>Rejuvenate all your HP</li>
                            <li>Rejuvenate the use of your Shade's Signature</li>
                            <li>Any action that the player has in mind can still be suggested, but up to DM discretion</li>
                        </ul>
                        The more you sacrifice, the more it may demand next time if your bond is weak. Sacrifices are permanent, and can be another number of things that hold value to a character,
                         body parts, memories, prized valuables, powers, companions (in certain cases), their own life

                        This ability is not foolproof however, as powerful Shades can still circumvent it.

                        6. Exorcist's Circle

                        and a hunter can convert up to TWO spell slots per round. The SPIRIT generated this way goes over SPIRIT cap, but the generated SPIRIT decays at the end of the round.

                        to a maximum of 20ft, each 5ft increase costs another 2SP. The domain will participate in domain clashes, but is unable to dispel other domains, 
                        instead on a won Domain Clash, creatures inside the blank domain will not be affected by domain affects. Blank Domain only needs 3/4 rolled value. 
                        At the start of every turn between the two domain users, another Domain Clash will occur.

                        8. Compacted Domain Technique 
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        When using a non-blank domain expansion, You can choose to create the domain at a much smaller space, condensing it but strengthening your authority over that space. 
                        The domain expansion will only be 10ft radius and will ignore the effects of the blank domains. 
                        The space where the compacted domain and another domain overlaps will become neutral, and neither domain expansions effects will register in that area. 
                        The domain can still be forcibly clashed with as a main action. You can convert an active domain into a compacted one and vice versa with a main action 
                    </dd>
                    <dt>

                    <dd>
                        In dire moments of need, the sheer physicality of the hosts body is able to surpass what even the soul is capable of. When using Rejuvenate Body, 
                        it no longer consumes SP. Rather as a main action, you restore HP equal to your missing SP from your max SP. This effect is tripled for Martials.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>

                    <dd>
                        Other Worlds Sense no longer costs SP and is a permanent effect on the host, after gaining enough proficiency in this ability,

                        11. Rapid Collapsing Domain
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        When using a domain expansion, you can choose to hastily expand it but in an unstable manner. The domain's effects will apply as if the targets have been in the domain for one turn. 
                        The domain will quickly collapse afterwards, however, by expanding domain so quickly, the host expands the domain and resolves the effects of the domain 
                        FASTER than a domain clash can occur, bypassing a domain clash and a blank domains effects. 
                    </dd>

                        12. Punishing Circle

                        You spend 1 minute making the Punishing Circle, player can draw an exorcist circle that has a 60ft radius. Shades within the circle will have their existence slowly 
                        punished and judged. They have a -1 to attack rolls and AC. Additionally, for every round the Shade stays in the circle, they gain a -1 to SPIRT DEF, up to a maximum of -3.
