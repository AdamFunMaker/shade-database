                                As a bonus action, you can create a contract for a willing, allied character within 50ft of you. The contract will impose a limitation on them, but bestow them an advantage. 
                                Pick one of the following restrictive effects:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Movement speed falls to 0, if the character is moved in any way, even if involuntary, the contract will be broken.</li>
                                    <li>HP will be unable to be restored for the duration of the contract, and character will lose 20% of their max HP per turn.</li>
                                    <li>Character is unable to make any attacks or hostile actions against any creatures/entities or otherwise</li>
                                    <li>Character becomes unable to use SPIRIT or Shade abilities, and loses 20% of their maximum SPIRIT per turn.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Next, the character will gain one of the following advantageous effects:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Movement speed is doubled for the duration of the contract</li>
                                    <li>Character gains advantage on all attack rolls</li>
                                    <li>Character regains SPIRIT equal to 3xPB per turn.</li>
                                    <li>Any effect up to DMs discretion.</li>
                                </ul>

                                If the contract is broken by the restrictive effects being disobeyed by the target creature, the creature will suffer damage equal to 20% of their Max HP and 20% of their 
                                Max Spirit.  The contract can be dissolved early as a bonus action but only after at least one round has passed since the contract's making. The contract terms will be 
                                loudly announced to all parties, including nearby characters. To maintain the contract, every round, the host's SP will decrease by 2.

                                and can only be deployed from yourself. Shade of Contracts, will detach from you, going high up in the air, and binds a number of creatures of its choice to a contract. 
                                This ability when used is counted as a Domain for the sake of Domain Clashes.

                                The effects Dividends, Fines and who chosen by the contracts, cannot be changed and must be designated when the domain is laid out. 
                                ONLY ONE SET OF RULES/DIVIDENDS/FINES CAN BE ACTIVE AT A TIME. To maintain the domain, every round, the host's SP will decrease by 6. 
                                Additionally, the host is unable to regain SP while the domain is deployed. The host can use their main action to dispel the domain early.
