            Resembles a little angry puppy made entirely of lightning sparks. It's overly energetic and zealous attitude often lands it in trouble, but it is an otherwise obedient little puppy dog. The luminosity of the lightning determines its mood, with happiness being indicated with a great overflow of electricity - to the point that anyone it touches is given a painful but harmless shock - or sadness/exhaustion being indicated with a barely noticeable spark from its hairs.

        <div class="ability-list">
            <div class="abilities">Electricity Manipulation (?SP): Expending SPIRIT, you may manipulate the electricity flows in appliances that you directly touch, you are still able to manipulate the power and electricity of those attached to the appliance, but at greater cost of SPIRIT. The SPIRIT cost to manipulate electricity is DMs discretion, but as a basic benchmark, 10 SPIRIT allows you to turn on and off a high powered flashlight just by touching it.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Travelling down the Current!: Shade of Lightning can travel through electrical currents and emerge from any entrance, no matter how small, even the crevices of a phone. However, due to Shade of Lightning's nature, this is hardly a way to stealthily infiltrate a location to find information. Shade of Lightning can go up to 60m away from its host, before zipping back out of fear.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Sparking Speed! (7SP): As a free action, for every 10ft movement you moved during the turn, you gain a +1 to attack rolls, this effect remains until the end of your turn.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Thunder As My Eye, I Need No Vision! (2SP/ATK): You can make an attack roll that cannot suffer from disadvantage or be reduced in any way.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Thunderspeed (4SP): Become as fast as the thunder, as a free action, you can double your movement speed.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="signature">
            <div>Before the Thunder Rumbles この前に雷の音 (15SP): If using Thunderspeed in the same turn, the SP cost of this ability will be halved, rounded down. As a main action, strike an enemy within melee range with Pochita being imbued and charged from within the sheathe of your blade. Once striking this enemy deal, lightning is charged inside the enemy. You may then use your free action to sheathe your sword, causing lightning to instantly rupture and spark out from within the enemy, dealing 12d6 lightning damage. This ability cannot crit, and it will be a main action to draw your sword once more.</div>
