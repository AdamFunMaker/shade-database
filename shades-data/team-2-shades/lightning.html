                Resembles a little angry puppy made entirely of lightning sparks. It's overly energetic and zealous attitude often lands it in trouble, but it is an otherwise 
                obedient little puppy dog. The luminosity of the lightning determines its mood, with happiness being indicated with a great overflow of electricity - 
                to the point that anyone it touches is given a painful but harmless shock - or sadness/exhaustion being indicated with a barely noticeable spark from its hairs.

                                If using Thunderspeed in the same turn, the SP cost of this ability will be halved, rounded down. As a main action, strike an enemy within melee range 
                                with Pochita being imbued and charged from within the sheathe of your blade. Once striking this enemy deal, lightning is charged inside the enemy. 
                                You may then use your free action to sheathe your sword, causing lightning to instantly rupture and spark out from within the enemy, dealing 12d6 lightning damage. 
                                This ability cannot crit, and it will be a main action to draw your sword once more. This ability targets SPIRIT DEF instead of AC.
