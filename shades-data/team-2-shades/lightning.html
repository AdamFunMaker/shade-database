          Resembles a little angry puppy made entirely of lightning sparks. It's overly energetic and zealous attitude often lands it in trouble, but it is an otherwise obedient little puppy dog. The luminosity of the lightning determines its mood, with happiness being indicated with a great overflow of electricity - to the point that anyone it touches is given a painful but harmless shock - or sadness/exhaustion being indicated with a barely noticeable spark from its hairs.

Shade of Lightning can go up to 60m away from its host, before zipping back out of fear.</p>

As a main action, strike an enemy within melee range with Pochita being imbued and charged from within the sheathe of your blade. Once striking this enemy deal, lightning is charged inside the enemy.

            <p>The weapon the host wields becomes charged with spiritual energy, emanating a fiery, volcanic glow and billowing ash from its blade. From the ashes, volcanic lightning starts to spark and flow, causing searing wounds in the enemies it slashes. As a bonus action, you can charge your weapon with volcanic and lightning energy. Your eyes start to glow orange akin to magma and lightning.
