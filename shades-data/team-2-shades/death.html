        <div class="ability-list">
            <div class="abilities">Scent of Death: Shade of Death is able to accurately discern the time of death of any deceased creature when touching any parts of its body. Additionally, Shade of Death can detect any creatures close to death i;e below half their maximum HP within 400ft.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Touch of Necrosis: When successfully landing an attack on a creature, if they are below half of their HP maximum, they take additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus. If this attack were to defeat a creature, you regain temp HP equal to a quarter of the damage dealt.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Life as my Currency: When the host character is drained of SP, the host character HP is instead supplemented as the SP, and is converted to SP to prevent SP drain effects.</div>
            <div class="signature">神さえも死を恐れる: Even Gods Fear Death (9SP/9HP per Round): As a bonus action, you physically manifest Shade of Death. It follows the ASI of your base character and takes it turn right after the host characters turn.  When Shade of Death is summoned, the host character can no longer regain SPIRIT, and when SPIRIT is drained, the host character can choose to consume HP instead, at a 1 for 1 HP to SP ratio.</div>
