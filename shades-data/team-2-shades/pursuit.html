            <div class="abilities">Superior Tracker (5SP): As an action, you can inspect a physical mark left by a creature (blood, prints, etc). Shade or Pursuit will be able to discern the direction in which they travelled within a range of 100ft of the original physical mark.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Bleeding Weakness (3SP/ATK): When successfully landing an attack on an enemy, you can expose it to a subsequent attack. The next attack roll you make against that target will be made with advantage.</div>
            <div class="abilities">Trial of the Hunt, Cull of the Weak: When gaining victories, you can choose to reroll buffs of the same tier when achieving a victory instead of taking a buff from a new tier, it will then replace that current tiers buff.</div>
            <div class="signature">SuÄ‘enje lova, Odstrel Slabih: Trial of the Hunt, Cull of the Weak (9SP/Round): As a free action, you designate a creature as a Trophy Kill, your first attack roll every round against this creature will be with advantage. Additionally, you are unable to lose track of the location of the creature unless it travels further than 800ft. If Shade of the Hunt deems the Hunt to be going well, you will be granted buffs, if Shade of the Hunt deems the Hunt to be going poorly, it will punish the Host. When any ally of the host kills a creature with Trophy Kill, regain spirit and HP equivalent to the killing blow, and the signature is cooldown is reset. The signature does not end when host goes down, instead Shade of Hunt will sustain the signature, making it cost no SP to maintain. Additionally, being defeated will escalate the current tier debuff immediately.</div>
