            The shade of nature resembles a small humanoid sprite made of
            flowers, vines and leaves. It can manipulate its size, appearing as
            a much larger humanoid, standing as tall as 7ft, or standing as
            small as a house cat. Shade of Nature has an echoing, monotone
            voice, but comes off as a warm, compassionate spirit.

                    Shade of Nature can make vegetation grow rapidly, imbueing
                    wilting plants and creatures with life force. Aside from
                    that, animals feel a calming presence when Shade of Nature
                    shows itself. Shade of Nature can also sprout smaller plants
                    and vegetation from its body, such as simple flowers or
                    vines. Even though Nature is a kind shade, it is more than
                    capable of defending itself and inflicting harm onto those
                    it wishes.

                    of the host, and makes THREE consecutive melee attacks
                    against a creature within 5ft. The attack rolls adds your
                    WIS mod + PB, and does 1d6+PB piercing damage. On a critical
                    hit, the target is grappled automatically by the thorn. The
                    thorn dissipates at the start of the host's next turn.

                    unoccupied 5ft square within 60ft. Hostile creatures must
                    make a WIS Saving throw. On a failure, they will immediately
                    move 20ft away from the Rafflessia, triggering opportunity

                    living creature within the range will lose max HP equal to
                    1d8 + half of their level per turn. Shade of Nature can
                    designate creatures within line of sight to have immunity to
                    the HP decay. If a creature moves more than 20ft while under
