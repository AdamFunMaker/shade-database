          SHADE OF NATURE
        </div>

        <div class="desc">
          The shade of nature resembles a small humanoid sprite made of flowers, vines and leaves. It can manipulate its size, appearing as a much larger humanoid,  standing as tall as 7ft, or standing as small as a house cat. Shade of Nature has an echoing, monotone voice, but comes off as a warm, compassionate spirit.

Aside from that, animals feel a calming presence when Shade of Nature shows itself. Shade of Nature can also sprout smaller plants and vegetation from its body, such as simple flowers or vines. Even though Nature is a kind shade, it is more than capable of defending itself and inflicting harm onto those it wishes. As a bonus action, you can now rapidly sprout plants imbued with your Spirit, giving the vegetation brief life and vitality to aid in battle.</p>
