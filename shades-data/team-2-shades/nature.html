            The shade of nature resembles a small humanoid sprite made of flowers, vines and leaves. It can manipulate its size, appearing as a much larger humanoid,  standing as tall as 7ft, or standing as small as a house cat. Shade of Nature has an echoing, monotone voice, but comes off as a warm, compassionate spirit.
