            A barely imperceptible colored-speck that exists around the host character. The color permeates an aura around the host, which rapidly change color when they use their shade technique. A shade that holds unspeakable power despite its simplicity, Shade of Colors is able to manipulate the properties and states of the matter around it.

        <div class="ability-list">
            <div class="abilities">Energy Color Shift: Red (6SP/Round): 
                When touching an object, you can rapidly displace or add energy to it. 
                For example, producing a fireball by holding a lit flame and rapidly adding heat energy to it, or rapidly taking away gravitational potential energy from an object, 
                preventing it from falling momentarily as it gathers it's potential energy again. This technique is heavily SPIRIT intensive, costing 6 SPIRIT per 6 seconds 
                a technique is active. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can add additional magical damage to a spell cast equal to 1/5 of SPIRIT used.
            </div>
            <div class="abilities">Substance Color Shift: Blue (6SP/Round): 
                By rapidly shifting energy and SPIRIT, the host can transmute simple materials, 
                such as a simple block of wood, carbon etc. Additionally, by consuming an exorbitant amount of SPIRIT, the host may attempt to transmute away solid objects, 
                but the rate at which is extremely slow and SPIRIT inefficient. The more complex the object, the more SPIRIT it takes.
            </div>
            <div class="abilities">Spirit Colour Shift: Yellow encapsulates the flow of Spirit energy in the world and it's creatures. Yellow rapidly shifts and manipulates the Spirit 
                of creatures, essentially bending it's will and it's life force. As a passive, you regenerate 1SP at the start of your turn.

            <div class="abilities"><h2>SIGNATURE</h2></div>
            <div class="abilities">Tsveta mira, Slit'sya V Odin: Colors of the World, Blend into One: By blending existing Color Shifts together, Shade of Colors can rapidly change 
                the properties and alter the energy values of the particles around it.
            </div>
            <div class="abilities">Matter Color Shift: Purple (20SP): As an action, the host character picks a simple object no bigger than the palm of his hand, 
                the object is rapidly compressed and charged with energy by Color Shift Blue and Color Shift Red. The object slowly becomes a glowing purple orb which can be launched 
                at any target within 400ft. Every creature the orb passes, make an attack roll against the creature. The orb will punch through any simple physical barriers and deals 
                (2 + proficiency bonus)d10 kinetic damage to any creature successfully hit by the orb. Every creature successfully hit by the attack will be debuffed with one of 
                TWO debuffs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Red: Creature is unable to move until the end of their next turn, as their energy is rapidly sapped away.</li>
                    <li>Blue: Creatures physical armor and resistances is rapidly deconstructed. Creature cannot benefit from resistances until the end of their next turn. </li>
                </ul>
            <div class="abilities">Potential Color Shift: Lime Green (22 SP): As a main action, by fusing Blue and Yellow together, rapidly shifting Spirit and Energy into the hosts body. 
                The host becomes charged with massive amounts of energy and Spirit before letting it release as multiple streams of emerald green lightning blasts at an enemy. 
                All creatures within a 60ft cone will make a DEX save, on a successful save they take half. Creatures will take damage equal to (2+PB) d12 psychic damage, as this 
                energy rends at the Spirit and their Energy. Creatures who fail the save for this ability will be unable to regain SPIRIT until the end of their next turn.
            </div>
            <div class="abilities">Dynamic Color Shift: Citrus Orange (14SP): As a reaction, when you were to be downed by a single instance of damage, you instead revert back to 
                half of your maximum HP and full SP. By fusing Red and Yellow together, you can rapidly regenerate your energy and spirit to prevent a fatal demise.
