          A barely imperceptible colored-speck that exists around the host character. The color permeates an aura around the host, which rapidly change color when they use their shade technique. A shade that holds unspeakable power despite its simplicity, Shade of Colors is able to manipulate the properties and states of the matter around it.

            <p><span style="color: gold;">Golden Yellow</span> has granted you near perfect control over your own spirit output, after a long rest, you can decrease SP costs of any of your abilities by up to 3x your proficiency bonus, you can allocate the reductions however you want (decrease purple by 9/ decrease amp blue, red, purple by 3 each).

          <div id="skill-content">
            <p>When touching an object, you can rapidly displace or add energy to it. For example, producing a fireball by holding a lit flame and rapidly adding heat energy to it, or rapidly taking away gravitational potential energy from an object, preventing it from falling momentarily as it gathers it's potential energy again. This technique is heavily SP intensive, costing <code>6SP</code> per 6 seconds a technique is active. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can add additional magical damage to a spell cast equal to 1/5 of SP used. 
                <br><br>
              As a bonus action, you can add red into ONE INSTANCE of the effect of a spell or a cantrip that you cast in the same turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has red). When using red, the spell or cantrip will target the enemy using it's Spirit DEF stat rather than its AC if it's an attack roll. Red also allows the spell or cantrip to ignore cover and line of sight, as well as extending the range of the ability by <code>30ft</code>. By expending another <code>3SP</code> for a total of <code>9SP</code>, you can enhance the effect of red on the spell/cantrip and deal an additional <code>d10</code> damage, and you can change the damage type of the ray to any damage type (except true).

          <div id="skill-content">
            <p>By rapidly shifting energy and SP, the host can transmute simple materials, such as a simple block of wood, carbon etc. Additionally, by consuming an exorbitant amount of SP, the host may attempt to transmute away solid objects, but the rate at which is extremely slow and SP inefficient. The more complex the object, the more SP it takes.
              <br><br>
              As a bonus action, you can add blue into ONE INSTANCE of the effect of a spell or a cantrip that you cast in the same turn. (Ala, scorching ray is 3 rays, but only 1 ray has red). When using blue, you are able to delay the casting and activation of spells and cantrips, storing the spell and cantrip within an item, surface, object or materialise the spell/cantrip as a barely physical blue orb. The spell will automatically trigger when the object or surface is destroyed, and if not, they are automatically casted at the start of your next turn. By expending another <code>3SP</code> for a total of <code>9SP</code>, you can enhance the effect of blue on the spell/cantrip to deal an additional <code>d10</code> damage and ignores resistances.
