            A six-eyed demon-like creature that thrives in Izaya's shadow, its
            true form is never revealed, but when it speaks, it sounds like an
            echoing version of Izaya's voice. When standing in the dark,
            creatures in the room with Izaya can sense an overbearing presence
            all around them.

                    Shade of Shadows can manipulate all manners of shadows and
                    darkness it touches, being able to bend it to its will to
                    any shape or form it wants. However, the shadow is just
                    that, and is not able to interact with anything physically.
                    Shade of Shadows is able to detach momentarily from its
                    host, traveling alongside darkness undetected, and can do so
                    up to 90ft away from the host as long as it stays within the
                    shadows and no light is shed on it. If light is shed on the
                    Shade, it is instantly banished back to its host, and the
                    host reduces by 8 SPIRIT.

                    character. In the event that the weight is too much, the
                    user will be crushed under the weight of his own shadow.
                    When the host is knocked unconscious, all the objects will
                    spill from the shadow.

                    Unlike other Shade Signatures, this signature can be used
                    multiple times. However, once a Puppet is killed, it can no
                    longer be summoned until a long rest. As an Action, the host
                    can summon shadowy creatures to its aid. Each creature has a
                    different SPIRIT upkeep and casting cost. All creatures
                    assume the ability scores of its host. The creatures will
                    take their turns independently. An Action can be used to
                    summon up to TWO puppets and a Bonus Action can be used to
                    summon ONE
