            A six-eyed demon-like creature that thrives in Izaya's shadow, its true form is never revealed, but when it speaks, it sounds like an echoing version of Izaya's voice. 
            When standing in the dark, creatures in the room with Izaya can sense an overbearing presence all around them.

            <div class="abilities">Shadow Manipulation (4SP):
                Shade of Shadows can manipulate all manners of shadows and darkness it touches, being able to bend it to its will to any shape or form it wants. However, the shadow is just 
                that, and is not able to interact with anything physically. Shade of Shadows is able to detach momentarily from its host, traveling alongside darkness undetected, 
                and can do so up to 90ft away from the host as long as it stays within the shadows and no light is shed on it. If light is shed on the Shade, 
                it is instantly banished back to its host, and the host reduces by 8 SPIRIT.

            <div class="abilities">Infinite Abyss: 
                Shade of Shadows is able to hold any inanimte object, but the weight of said object will be endured by the host character. In the event that the weight is too much, the 
                user will be crushed under the weight of his own shadow. When the host is knocked unconscious, all the objects will spill from the shadow.

                Unlike other Shade Signatures, this signature can be used multiple times. However, once a Puppet is killed, it can no longer be summoned until a long rest. As an Action, 
                the host can summon shadowy creatures to its aid. Each creature has a different SPIRIT upkeep and casting cost. All creatures assume the ability scores of its host. 
                The creatures will take their turns independently. An Action can be used to summon up to TWO puppets and a Bonus Action can be used to summon ONE
