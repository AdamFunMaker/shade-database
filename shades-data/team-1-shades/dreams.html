            <p>You can hop into the dreams of a character you see dreaming as long as your character is sleeping and within 100ft of the target. You will then walk amongst their dream without them knowing, in it, you will be able to interact and speak with the dreamer, but have no control over the dream itself. The dream reality may not behave proper rules of reality, -objects may not be destroyed, sudden drops in floors to an unending abyss-. You may exit the dream, and if the dreamer wakes up, you and the Shade of Dreams will be violently jettisoned from it. Additionally, some characters may be aware of a Shade's powers due to its emittance of SPIRIT, and may figure out that it is a Shade attack. You can drag nearby sleeping creatures into another dream as long as they are within 100ft of the host as well. You can drag a number of creatures equal to your SOUL or MIND stat</p>

            <p>Usable when one, two or three of your allies fall or you make a costly binding vow
              <br><br>
              Using a binding vow that eats into your lifespan, this is a final trump card you only pull when you're absolutely pushed against the corner. Your entire form becomes shrouded in unspeakable horrors, and your very form becomes ungraspable by the human eye. Your cloak becomes elongated and nightmarish and you gain a number of new effects:
              <br>
              -You gain the ability to passively manifest illusions of fears around your enemies and targets, you learn minor illusion if you do not already have it, and you can cast it as a bonus action.
              <br>
              -Creatures that look at you for the first time must make a WIS saving throw or take PBD12 psychic damage 
              <br>
              -All your spells can be converted to psychic damage
              <br>
              -Your attacks can target SPIRIT DEF instead of AC.
              <br>
              -Whenever you lose HP because of a Nightmare ability, you gain temp HP equal to the HP lost.
              <br><br>
              Additionally, whenever you cast a spell that deals damage, you benefit from one, two or three of these effects:
              <br>
              Fear: Deals an additional PBd10 Psychic, rounded up damage to the creature.
              <br>
              Despair: Recover HP equal to PBD10
              <br>
              Regret: Give an advantage on the next roll to yourself or a disadvantage to the affected creatures next roll.
