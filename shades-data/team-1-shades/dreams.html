            A disembodied floating cloud that appears differently to everyone depending on the person. Is generally a very enthusiastic and optimistic mind, 
            keeping a cheery attitude no matter what the circumstance. Has a childlike attitude of hopefulness.

            A disembodied floating eldritch horror with six arms. Is very vague and cryptic in its speech, and exudes an ominous personality, 
            but seems helpful when it needs to be. It seems to be keeping some cards behind its hand

        <div class="ability-list">
            <div class="abilities">Dreamwalker (5SP): 
                You can hop into the dreams of a character you see dreaming as long as your character is sleeping and within 100ft of the target. 
                You will then walk amongst their dream without them knowing, in it, you will be able to interact and speak with the dreamer, but have no control over the dream itself. 
                The dream reality may not behave proper rules of reality, -objects may not be destroyed, sudden drops in floors to an unending abyss. 
                You may exit the dream, and if the dreamer wakes up, you and the Shade of Dreams will be violently jettisoned from it. 
                Additionally, some characters may be aware of a Shade's powers due to its emittance of SPIRIT, and may figure out that it is a Shade attack. 
                You can drag nearby sleeping creatures into another dream as long as they are within 100ft of the host as well. 
                You can drag a number of creatures equal to your SOUL or MIND stat

            <div class="abilities">Dreamwatcher: 
                As a passive ability with no SP cost, your character can vaguely hear/see the daydreams and wandering thoughts of people around them, 
                but it's fairly fuzzy and random, almost impossible to glean exact details from it.
            </div>
            <div class="abilities">Dreams Evade Reality (4SP/R): 
                As a reaction, when an allied character except yourself fails a save or ability check within 25ft, you may add your WIS mod to the save.

            <div class="abilities">Ber√∞u draumana, Carry the Dreams of those No Longer with Us (7SP/Round): As a main action, you can open a domain that spans from you. 
                The domain has a radius of 90ft. All allied creatures when first entering the domain gain +5 max HP. 
                All allied creatures within the domain have a +1 to saving throws and +1 to attack rolls as they are encouraged and egged on by visions of those they have lost. 
                While within the domain, before the resolution of a roll has been decided, an allied creature can add the host's WIS mod to any roll they make. When doing so, 
                the host's SP will decrease by that amount. This ability can be used up to a number of times equal to the hosts PB per round. 
                This ability counts as a domain for the sake of domain clashes
