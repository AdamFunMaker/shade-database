                        A disembodied floating cloud that appears differently to everyone depending on the person. Is generally a very enthusiastic and optimistic mind, 
                        keeping a cheery attitude no matter what the circumstance. Has a childlike attitude of hopefulness.

                        A disembodied floating eldritch horror with six arms. Is very vague and cryptic in its speech, and exudes an ominous personality, 
                        but seems helpful when it needs to be. It seems to be keeping some cards behind its hand

                                You will then walk amongst their dream without them knowing, in it, you will be able to interact and speak with the dreamer, but have no control over the dream itself. 
                                The dream reality may not behave proper rules of reality, -objects may not be destroyed, sudden drops in floors to an unending abyss. 
                                You may exit the dream, and if the dreamer wakes up, you and the Shade of Dreams will be violently jettisoned from it. 
                                Additionally, some characters may be aware of a Shade's powers due to its emittance of SPIRIT, and may figure out that it is a Shade attack. 
                                You can drag nearby sleeping creatures into another dream as long as they are within 100ft of the host as well.

                                Shade of Dreams can manifest different types of dreams to warp reality and impose illusions that can fool even reality 
                                onto the battlefield. Neru enters a dreamlike state and is able to manipulate that battlefield from where he stands. These include:

                                        Manifesting your day dreams into illusory reality, Shade of Dreams can deter attacks from hostiles. As a bonus action, 
                                        pick an allied character you can see within 25ft. Until the end of their next turn, when a creature targets them for an attack roll, 
                                        Neru can roll a WIS Saving throw against the enemy's save DC. On a save, the creature is unable to target them.

                                        As a main action, you start to inspire hope and serenity into the souls and hearts of your allies. 
                                        Pick a number of characters equal to your proficiency bonus within 25ft will gain max spirit equal to your proficiency bonus + half your level rounded up, 
                                        these creatures also add a bonus equal to their proficiency bonus to initiative rolls and perception rolls, even if they already have proficiency.

                                All allied creatures within the domain have a +1 to saving throws and +1 to attack rolls as they are encouraged and egged on by visions of those they have lost. 
                                While within the domain, before the resolution of a roll has been decided, an allied creature can add the host's WIS mod to any roll they make. When doing so, 
                                the host's SP will decrease by that amount. This ability can be used up to a number of times equal to the hosts PB per round. 
                                This ability counts as a domain for the sake of domain clashes
